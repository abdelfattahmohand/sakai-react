## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**
- **npm** or **yarn** package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sakai-react.git
   cd sakai-react

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Themes

Sakai React offers extensive theme support, allowing you to customize the look and feel of your application effortlessly. The available themes include:

- **Bootstrap**:
- **Material UI**: 
- **Tailwind CSS**: 
- **Fluent UI**: 
- **PrimeOne Themes**: 
- **Lara Theme**:

You can easily switch between these themes to match your application's design requirements. All themes are open source and free to use.

## Customization

The source code is organized for easy customization:

- **Layout Components**: Located in the `src` directory, including `App.js`, `AppTopbar`, `AppFooter`, `AppMenu`, and `AppConfig`.
- **Menu Structure**: The menu items are defined in `App.js` as a nested JSON structure. You can modify this structure or load it from an external source like a JSON file or database.
- **Styling**: Customize the look and feel using CSS or by modifying the theme variables. The layout is scalable based on font sizes; increasing the body font size will scale up the entire application.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests. We are especially interested in community efforts to port Sakai React to other frameworks like Next.js or to other ecosystems like Vue.js.
